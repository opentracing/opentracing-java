# OpenTracing API for Java

This library is a Java platform API for OpenTracing.

## Required Reading

In order to understand the Java platform API, one must first be familiar with
the [OpenTracing project](http://opentracing.io) and
[terminology](http://opentracing.io/documentation/pages/spec.html) more specifically.

## Status

This project has a working design of interfaces for the OpenTracing API. There
is a [MockTracer](https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-java/tree/master/opentracing-mock)
to facilitate unit-testing of OpenTracing Java instrumentation.

Packages are deployed to Maven Central under the `io.opentracing` group.

# Development

This is a maven project, and provides a wrapper, `./mvnw` to pin a consistent
version. For example, `./mvnw clean install`.

This wrapper was generated by `mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper -Dmaven=3.3.9`

## Building

Execute `./mvnw clean install` to build, run tests, and create jars.
